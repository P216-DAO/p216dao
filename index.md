## P216 DAO NFT GAME

This project working with numbers! No need web sites, interface or web3.js integration!


## How you can interact with contract?
For example if you wanna play a #NFT game with 0.01 ETH.

```markdown
Just send 0.010-333-1 in other words  `0.0103331`  eth to contract.
```

First 3 decimals is your play amount for example first 3 decimals can be 0.100 or 0.005, 0.009 or 0.900  

Between three and six decimals **333**- is means i wanna play a game.

Last 1 means i think NEXT block's blockhash's decimal value is ODD.

if you send 0.0103332 --> (2) means  i think NEXT block's blockhash's decimal value is EVEN.

if your prediction is true! You will earn GREEN robot and 2x -(%15).

If your prediction is false! You will earn RED robot.

If you send 1 ethereum to contract, you can buy a BLUE robot directly and all Blue Robot owners earn %10 commission from all winners!

Only 100 blue ROBOT can exist.

That is all, Good lucks...
